# GraphQL-Schema-and-Support
Contains a breakdown of the GraphQL Schema and how to explore it.

This repository was created in response to CESMII AND THINKIQ CORE PLATFORM LICENSE AGREEMENT. See *"Exhibt B"* -> *"Platform Project Part II"*

## Exploring the Schema

### Use the Graphiql Tool within a Platform instance
The GraphQL schema can be explored on any platform instance using the tools that have been built into each instance. These tools are available to users within the Group ‘Configurators’. Follow these steps to start exploring the Schema on any instance:
1.	Navigate to the menu *Item Developer -> Request Header Token*
2.	Click the *Copy Token* Button and then click *Open GraphiQL*, bringing you to a new tool
3.	In the bottom portion of the tool, select *Request Headers* and paste the copied text into box, completely replacing the text
4.	You may now query the schema and explore the model for this platform instance using this tool.

Note that this schema will be the same for all platform instances.

### See CESMII Documentation
The CESMII and ThinkIQ relationship has yielded many examples, documents and learnings about how best to interact with the platform via GraphQL.

Check out the CESMII github on the [GraphQL-API](https://github.com/cesmii/GraphQL-API). Here there are examples, documents and more.
